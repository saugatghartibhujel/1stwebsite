    <h3> My name is Saugat Gharti Bhujel. I am 19 years old and currently studying in Grade XII at Southwestern State College, specializing in Computer Science. I have a strong interest in technology, especially in IT and programming.

Alongside academics, I have been actively involved in Rotary through the Interact movement. I began my Interact journey in 2022 from Interact Club of Valley Public School, where I later served as the IT Head. After that, I joined Interact Club of Matribhumi Baluwatar, continuing my dedication to service, leadership, and digital management.

I consider myself a hardworking, curious, and growth-oriented person who enjoys learning new skills, taking responsibilities, and contributing positively to any team I become a part of.</h3>
